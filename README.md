# ML-project

📘 **Machine Learning Practice Project** using the **Depression dataset**

I trained both **classification** and **regression** models on this dataset using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**.  

- 🧩 **Classification Notebook:** Predicts categories from the dataset  
- 📈 **Regression Notebook:** Predicts continuous values related to the same dataset
